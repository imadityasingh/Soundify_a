# 🎙️ Image Processing and Machine Learning Based Voice Prediction App

> 🔍 **Bridging Vision and Audio with AI** — This project uses **Image Processing** and **Machine Learning** techniques to predict or generate voice output based on visual inputs.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The **Image Processing and Machine Learning Based Voice Prediction App** is an innovative project that combines the power of **computer vision** and **speech technology**.  
The app can analyze an image — such as a person’s facial expressions, lip movements, or visual context — and predict a **corresponding voice or speech output** using trained ML models.

This project demonstrates how multimodal AI systems can enhance **human–computer interaction**, accessibility, and automation.
